## Void Linux Installation

The system is set up on a ext4 file system nested within an encrypted LVM volume.

## Configuration and Ricing

I have opted for SwayFx with Waybar, following all my requirements. Both Wlogout and Swaylock function seamlessly and can be customized easily. I droped Hyprland because it was to heavy for me, and it's updated to often for me, I need something stable and minimal, SwayFx is perfect for that.

## Software

- **Libvirt with KVM/QEMU:** Used for managing all my virtual machines.
- **Neovim:** My preferred text editor for smaller projects.
- **Obsidian:** Utilized for note-taking and organization.
- **Thunar File Manager:** Handling file management tasks.
- **Alacritty Terminal:** Serving as my terminal emulator.

Feel free to explore and adapt elements of my workflow to enhance your's. If you're interested, my dotfiles and potentially an installation script are available within this repository.
